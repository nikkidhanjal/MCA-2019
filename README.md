WEEK 1: Musical Datasets 
I have chosen the theme of Film Scores for my dataset. 

Considering much of these pieces will; have been createsd by composers, there are scores available, hence notated data. Acouostic data exists in the form of recorded music, and live performances, and there is much metadata about each piece to build up descriptive data. 

There already exist datasets for movie soundtracks in the form of Spotify playlists, such as playlists for particular movies or composers, or compilations like "Movie Soundtracks". There are also databases online, which allow you to browse and discover movie soundtracks.
