<h1>WEEK 1: Musical Datasets</h1>
I have chosen the theme of: **Film Scores** for my dataset. 

Considering much of these pieces have been created by composers, there are already scores available, hence notated data. Acouostic data exists in the form of recorded music, so the actual audio of the scores, and there is much metadata about each piece to build up descriptive data, such as composer, title,  and so on. 

There already exist datasets for movie scores, for example in the form of Spotify playlists, such as playlists for particular movies or composers, or compilations like "Film Scores and Soundtracks - Best Of". There are also databases online, which allow you to browse and discover music in relation to this theme, for example compiled lists of scores, such as Classic FM's '25 best film scores from the passt 25 years'. 

In the example of Spotify, the data is presented as the 'Title', 'Artist', 'Album', date of upload and duration of song. In the example of the Classic FM list, data is presented as the title, composer, and year of production. 


<h1>WEEK 2: Notated Music</h1>
I have chosen the piece 'Casper's Lullaby' by James Horner, from the movie Casper.

<h1>WEEK8: Music as Sound</h1>
The fundamental difference between waveforms and spectograms is that waveforms present data in a graph of time against amplitude, whereas spectograms present data in a graph of time against frequency. Waveforms only include basic information about amplitude, such as when audio is loud and quieter, but not much else. Spectograms, on the other hand, show more information about the sound, such as frequency, which represents pitch. For example, using the third song example, "ID_03", the heat mappings against pitch show a lot of the frequencies are within the middle frequency range.
