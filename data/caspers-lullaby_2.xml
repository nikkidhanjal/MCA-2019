      <name>Number of Pitches</name>
      <description>Number of unique pitches that occur at least once in the piece. Enharmonic equivalents are grouped together for the purpose of this calculation.</description>

   <feature>
      <name>Mean Pitch</name>
      <description>Mean MIDI pitch value, averaged across all pitched notes in the piece. Set to 0 if there are no pitched notes.</description>

   <feature>
      <name>Mean Pitch Class</name>
      <description>Mean pitch class value, averaged across all pitched notes in the piece. A value of 0 corresponds to a mean pitch class of C, and pitches increase chromatically by semitone in integer units from there (e.g. a value of 2 would mean that D is the mean pitch class). Enharmonic equivalents are treated as a single pitch class.</description>

   <feature>
      <name>Most Common Pitch Class</name>
      <description>The pitch class that occurs most frequently compared to other pitch classes. A value of 0 corresponds to C, and pitches increase chromatically by semitone in integer untis (e.g. a value of 2 would mean that D is the most common pitch class). Enharmonic equivalents are treated as a single pitch class.</description>

   <feature>
      <name>Pitch Variability</name>
      <description>Standard deviation of the MIDI pitches of all pitched notes in the piece. Provides a measure of how close the pitches as a whole are to the mean pitch.</description>

   </feature>

   <feature>
      <name>First Pitch</name>
      <description>The MIDI pitch value of the first note in the piece. If there are multiple notes with simultaneous attacks at the beginning of the piece, then the one with the lowest pitch is selected. Set to 0 if there are no pitched notes.</description>

   </feature>

   <feature>
      <name>Last Pitch</name>
      <description>The MIDI pitch value of the last note in the piece. If there are multiple notes with simultaneous attacks at the end of the piece, then the one with the lowest pitch is selected. Set to 0 if there are no pitched notes.</description>

   <feature>
      <name>Chord Type Histogram</name>
      <description>A feature vector consisting of bin magnitudes of the chord type histogram described in the jSymbolic manual. This is a normalized histogram that has bins labeled with types of chords (in the following order and with the indicated identifying codes): partial chords consisting of just two pitch classes [0], minor triads [1], major triads [2], diminished triads [3], augmented triads [4], other triads [5], minor seventh chords [6], dominant seventh chords [7], major seventh chords [8], other chords consisting of four pitch classes [9], and complex chords with more than four pitch classes [10]. The bin magnitudes are calculated by going through MIDI ticks one by one and incrementing the counter for the bin that corresponds to the chord, if any, that is present during eah given tick; the result is that the chords in this histogram are weighted by the duration with which each chord is played. All inversions are treated as equivalent and octave doubling is ignored in the calculation of this histogram. Melodic behaviour is not considered, so arpeggios are not counted in this histogram.</description>
